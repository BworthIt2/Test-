'''thsi is way better make a dictionary of all of the modesl hat are fast in coqio to select from for the speaker value, for them
and the spaeker value will be None if it isnt a ulti voice one, whihc is most of them
BUT if it does then you can set it to seom voice within the three that do so that w=should make the if statment a lot shorter

so then you can just amke it 

make a disctonary of the speakers to set for each model witht eh rtules above

fast_voice_cloning_models= "get mdoels command"

if the model selected for voice cloning is one fo the fast ones then:
